# Connected Regions Problem

------------------------------
Suddenly, a voice echoes in the minds of the crew.

'Are you the seekers of knowledge?'

Uncertain, the crew members look at each other.

"What knowledge do you bring?" asks the inner voice.

As this question fills the air, a map appears on the pedestal.


The challenge appears to be to figure out and count the cells in this extensive connected region, considering the possibility of multiple regions in this map. Cells are considered connected if they are next to each other, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The diagram below depicts two regions of the map. Connected regions are filled with X or Y. Zeros are replaced with dots for clarity.
